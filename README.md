# Matchstick
Creation du jeu marienbad en C

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
There is a certain number of matchstick lines.
The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

Use the command "make" to compile
and do "./matchstick <number_of_line> <max_matches>"
The program will return 1 if you win and 2 if you loose
The user will always start the game.
